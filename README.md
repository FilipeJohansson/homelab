# Homelab Setup with Docker Compose

This repository contains the configuration for my personal **homelab** environment, leveraging Docker Compose to manage and deploy essential self-hosted services. It serves as a space for **continuous learning**, **network management**, and **experimentation** in a contained and isolated environment.

## Services Included

- **Pi-hole**: A network-wide ad blocker and DNS sinkhole to block unwanted content and enhance privacy.
- **Nginx Proxy Manager**: A user-friendly reverse proxy with SSL certificate management.
- **Portainer**: A powerful, yet simple, management UI for Docker containers.
- **Glances**: A real-time system monitoring tool to keep track of the performance of your setup.
- **Code-Server**: A self-hosted version of Visual Studio Code for browser-based development.

## Features

- **Docker-based**: All services are containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy, manage, and update.
- **Network Management**: A dedicated internal network for all containers ensures smooth communication and separation from the host.
- **Continuous Learning**: This setup is designed to experiment with different services, tools, and configurations in a safe and isolated environment.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose
